## What the-?

- **JavaScript frameworks** are pre-written JavaScript libraries
designed to simplify the development of JavaScript-based applications.
- They provide **reusable components** and a structured way to organize code.

---

## Why the-?
- Faster development.
- Easier maintenance.
- Built-in solutions for common problems.

---

## Napr.

### Frontend Frameworks
- **React**
- **Vue.js** (progressive framework)
- **Angular**
- **Svelte** (compiler-based framework)
# nou
### Backend Frameworks
- **Node.js** (runtime environment)
- **Express.js** (minimalist backend framework)
- **Next.js** (React-based full-stack framework)
- **NestJS** (scalable backend framework)

---

## Fullstack Development

- Fullstack JavaScript frameworks provide tools to build both the frontend and backend of an application using a single language, JavaScript.
- They unify development workflows and reduce the need for switching between languages or environments.

---

### Advantages

- Single Language: Developers only need to learn JavaScript for the entire stack.
- Code Sharing: Share business logic and utilities between frontend and backend.
- Efficiency: Faster development cycles with streamlined workflows.
- Scalability: Many frameworks support serverless deployments and cloud-native architecture.

---

### Components of a Fullstack Framework

- Frontend Tools: Built-in routing, state management, and templating for interactive UIs.
- Backend Features: Server rendering, REST/GraphQL API generation, and middleware.
- Database Integration: Direct integration with databases like MongoDB, PostgresQL, etc.

---

### Real-World Applications

- Enterprise applications requiring real-time features.
- Static websites with dynamic components.
- Full-fledged SPAs (Single Page Applications) and PWAs (Progressive Web Apps).

---

## Self-Serve Creation and Deployment

- Many modern JavaScript frameworks offer self-serve tools that simplify app creation and deployment without requiring extensive DevOps knowledge.
- These tools help developers quickly set up, build, and deploy applications.

---

### Key Features

- CLI Tools: Command-line tools like create-next-app or vue-cli for scaffolding projects with best practices.
- Boilerplates: Pre-configured templates to jumpstart projects.
- Hosting Integration: Easy deployment to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or Firebase.
- Dev Tools: Built-in debugging, testing, and live-reloading for development convenience.

---

### Benefits of Self-Serve

- Speed: Developers can deploy apps in minutes with minimal setup.
- Accessibility: No need for deep cloud infrastructure knowledge.
- Flexibility: Supports both static and dynamic deployments.
- Scalability: Handle small projects to enterprise-grade apps effortlessly.

---

### Examples of Self-Serve Applications

- A startup building and deploying a new MVP using Next.js and Vercel.
- Personal portfolio websites hosted on Netlify.
- Educational or community apps built with React and deployed on Firebase.

## Prečo si vybrať?

### Key Benefits
1. **Improved Productivity**
    - Avoid reinventing the wheel.
2. **Better Code Organization**
    - Modular and maintainable structure.
3. **Cross-Platform Development**
    - Many frameworks support web, mobile, and desktop development.

---

## Ako si vybrať?

### Considerations
- **Project Requirements**: Small apps vs. enterprise solutions.
- **Learning Curve**: Developer experience with tools like TypeScript or JSX.
- **Community Support**: Active communities ensure better libraries and resources.

---

## Zhrnutie
- JavaScript frameworks simplify the development process.
- Choosing the right framework depends on project goals and team expertise.
- Explore and experiment with different frameworks to find the best fit.
